--Tiles on CartoDB are created at 200x200. There is no easy workaround for a grid where the tile isn't divisble by the grid w/h. So, 200/16 wont work. We need to either, pick a different cell size here, 20, or retile the input raster to say 256. I like the later, but it will require CartoDB code change. We have gone from 10x10, to 100x100, to 200x200 each time finding different reasons for the change to a more equally optimal coding. Now, I'd say 256 would be a super versitile tile size, duh. (note: 256 tile sizes will not often align to gmaps)
